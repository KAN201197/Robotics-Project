# ME5400A Robotics Project

This project aims to design and develop an Autonomous Mobile Robot for food delivery using mecanum wheel robot. The objective of this project is for the robot to navigate into three different positions by calling or giving the coordinates of the exact position while avoiding every dynamic obstacle. This project is still going to develop the robot arm which is attached to the top of the mobile robot to become a mobile manipulator that can be used to manipulate the object (grip something or press something) as well as add another sensor such as GPS to be able to navigate more accurately in complex and dynamic environments outside of the building.

## List of Executable Files

Below are listed the executable files and folders in this repo:

1. Metric_Calculation

   Inside this folder has a list of executable files to measure a performance of the choosen global and local path planner by calculating the metric calculation such as path length, execution time, initialization time, etc.
